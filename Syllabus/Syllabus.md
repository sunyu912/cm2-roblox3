# Roblox 3 Syllabus

Roblox 3 continues the topics that were discussed in Roblox 1 and 2, but with a larger emphasis on scripting and on artificial intelligence in Roblox. Students will go more in depth with Roblox development and learn the tools needed to truly make a game come to life. Topics covered are NPC creation, pathfinding, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), and raycasting. Students will elevate their creativity in Roblox by implementing more complex features to make their projects richer in quality. Roblox 3 is split into four modules, each of which have several mini projects that effectively demonstrate the topic used in a realistic game scenario.

## MODULE 1. NPC Creation
In this module, students will create several NPCs and program varying behaviors to help bring them to life.
