# Lesson 8: Protective A.I. Companion (Part 3)

Let's learn how to improve our A.I. companion again! This time, we will create a user interface for the companion. This U.I. will include commands like:  

-   "Standby"
-   "Alert"
-   "Heal"

It will also be able to set the follow distance gap and how far the companion can go before returning to the player.  

We will be utilizing the following topics:

- Scripts 
- Values

## Setting Up the Companion U.I.

In this lesson, we will create settings for the companion's detection range and healing powers. Visit this [link](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Intro-to-GUIs)  for a refresher on G.U.I.s and positioning U.I. items relative to the screen.

1. Click the + button next to `StarterGui`, add a `ScreenGui`, (red in image) and rename it to "CompanionGUI".

2. We need to create incremental buttons to adjust values so we don't have to input them manually (it can be done manually, but it will have to handle wrong data types inputted). Let's begin by creating a title label, signifying to players that they opened the companion's menu. 

   Click the + button next to `CompanionGui`, add a `TextLabel`, (red in image) and rename it to "CompanionLabel".

   ![image](https://storage.googleapis.com/cm-image-repository.appspot.com/roblox_3/Deprecated%20Lessons/L8/605d5987-c88d-4821-bc6e-1b89a24fa36a.png)

   **Note**: The difference between `TextLabel` and `TextBox` is that `TextLabel` cannot be clicked on and changed during the game, but `TextBox` can. If you want to use inputs instead of incremental buttons, use `TextBox`.

3. There are four main properties we will be working with for all U.I. items:

   - Text--this holds all things related to text visuals. Navigate to `CompanionLabel`'s properties and check off `TextScaled` (red in image) so the text is resized to be as big as the label.

     ![image](https://storage.googleapis.com/cm-image-repository.appspot.com/roblox_3/Deprecated%20Lessons/L8/79907ad0-a731-43fb-aff8-c972c3410622.png)

   - AnchorPoint--a specific point on the object to used to align it with the screen. We want to adjust its coordinates so it is located at the center of the label. Again in `CompanionLabel`'s properties, find AnchorPoint (red in image) and change it to 0.5, 0.5.

     ![image](https://storage.googleapis.com/cm-image-repository.appspot.com/roblox_3/Deprecated%20Lessons/L8/82f2baba-6a70-4d90-b8dc-26d295a72843.png)

   - Position--determines where the object is. We want it centered on X but near the top of Y. Other things that can be adjusted are the *scale*, the percentage of the object's width or height, and the *offset,* the number of pixels away the object is from the origin, (0,0). Click the white arrow to the left of Position (red in first image) to expand, and input the values seen in the second image.

   - Size--changes the width or height of the item itself. This works similarly to Position: if you set the sizes to be 0.1, it will take up 1/10 of the screen size. Click the white arrow to the left of Size (red in first image) to expand, and input the values seen in the second image.

4. Click the + button next to `CompanionGui`, add a TextLabel (red in image), and rename it to `RangeLabel`. In its properties, change its text to say "range".

5. Click the + button next to `RangeLabel`, add a TextButton (red in image), and rename it to `MinusButton`.

   ![image](https://storage.googleapis.com/cm-image-repository.appspot.com/roblox_3/Deprecated%20Lessons/L8/924b64cc-3056-49f1-92de-9183e961dcbb.png)

   

6. In `MinusButton`'s properties, change its text (red in image) to a minus sign.

   ![image](https://storage.googleapis.com/cm-image-repository.appspot.com/roblox_3/Deprecated%20Lessons/L8/6c0b9482-1abc-426e-a434-250f4ceb2722.png)

7. Click the + button next to "MinusButton", add a Script (red in image), and rename it to "MinusScript".

   ![image](https://storage.googleapis.com/cm-image-repository.appspot.com/roblox_3/Deprecated%20Lessons/L8/199283c1-e2f5-472f-933b-be3f99873374.png)

8. We need a few things in "MinusScript":

   - When this button is pressed, the Companion's range value must be decreased by one.
   - We need to find the companion that is assigned to us before we can access its range value.

   Notice how findCompanion( ) is similar to getPlayerFromName( )? Try the script out and you'll notice the range values changing! Add this code:

```lua
local playerName = script.Parent.Parent.Parent.Parent.Parent.Name
local companion = null

function findCompanion (name)
    local list = game.Workspace:GetChildren()
    
    for x = 1, #list do
        
        local object = list[x]
        if (object.className == "Model") and (object ~= script.Parent) then
            
            local human = object:findFirstChild("Companion")
            if human ~= nil and object.Leader.Value == playerName then
                return object
            end
        end
   end
end


repeat
    wait(0.1)
    companion = findCompanion()
    print("Searching for companion...")
until companion ~= nil

script.Parent.MouseButton1Click:Connect(function())
    print("Clicked")
    if companion.Range.Value > 0 then
        companion.Range.Value = companion.Range.Value - 1
        print(companion.Range.Value)
    end
end)
```

9. Right click on `MinusButton` and click duplicate. Change the new `MinusButton` to `PlusButton`, and adjust its text to be + instead of - (red in image). Change the duplicated script to `PlusScript`, and replace line 29 of its script with this:

    ```lua
    companion.Config.detectionRange.Value = companion.Config.detectionRange.Value + 1
    ```

10. Let's finish up by creating a button to toggle the menu on and off. Click the + button next to `CompanionGUI`, add a TextButton (red in image), and rename it to `ToggleLabel`. In its properties, change its text to say "Menu Toggle." You can adjust the position and sizes later.   

    ![image](https://storage.googleapis.com/cm-image-repository.appspot.com/roblox_3/Deprecated%20Lessons/L8/f7f51859-a0e6-4be3-a4c1-199e54667205.png)

11. Click the + button next to `ToggleLabel`, add a Script, and rename it to `ToggleScript`. Place a script inside toggleLabel and name it `toggleScript`. Add this code:

    ```lua
    local list = script.Parent.Parent:GetChildren()
    
    script.Parent.MouseButton1Click:Connect(function())
        for i = 1, #list do
            local object = list[i]
            
            if object.Name ~= script.Parent.Name then
                
                if object.Visible == true then
                    object.Visible = false
                else
                    object.Visible = true
                end
            end
        end
    end
    ```

12. If you haven't already, adjust the buttons' sizes and positions so your GUI looks like this:

Congratulations--your A.I. companion is now improved! Click play to test out its new functions!

## Post-Class Deliverables

1.  Help students finish up their programs. Ensure students save their product, give it a title, and upload it to ShareMyWorks. Greet parents as they arrive and passout/explain homework to students and ensure their parents know they have homework to bring back.

2.  For this class, remember to always have them publish their script on Roblox. We will be grabbing them again and again for future lessons.
