## Module L3-1: Getting Started with AI Pathfinding
Let's learn AI Pathfinding!

We will be utilizing the following topics:

- Parts
- Model
- Script

  

### Setting Up the Start and Finish

1.  Spawn 2 Parts in Workspace (in red).

2.  Click on each part and under Properties --> Data --> Name, change the name of the part to Start and Finish (in red).

### Creating the Pathfinding Script

Let's start using the pathfinding functions and see how it works. Open up Roblox Studio.

1. Add a model called Waypoints into your Workspace.
    - Hover over Workspace and click on the + (plus) sign
    - Under the search bar, type "Model" and click on the Model option that shows up (in red).

    - Click on the Model and under Properties --> Data --> Name, change the name to "Waypoints" (make sure this is spelled right, case sensitive)

2.  Add an empty Script into Workspace
    - Hover over Workspace and click on the + (plus) sign
    - Under the options displayed, click Script (in red). You can rename it as PathfindingScript.

3.  Copy and Paste the following code inside the script:
    ```lua
    -- Continuously calculating
    while true do
    	
    	-- Create the path object
    	path = game:GetService("PathfindingService"):CreatePath()
    	
    	-- Compute the path
    	path:ComputeAsync(workspace.Start.Position, workspace.Finish.Position)
    	
    	-- Get the path waypoints
    	waypoints = path:GetWaypoints()
    	
    	-- Clear the placed waypoints
    	game.Workspace.Waypoints:ClearAllChildren()
    	
    	-- For each waypoint
    	for _, waypoint in pairs(waypoints) do
    		part = Instance.new("Part")
    		part.Shape = "Ball"
    		part.Material = "Neon"
    		part.Size = Vector3.new(0.6, 0.6, 0.6)
    		part.Position = waypoint.Position
    		part.Anchored = true
    		part.CanCollide = false
    		part.Parent = game.Workspace.Waypoints
    		
    		wait(0.5)
    		
    	end
    	
    end
    ```
        
4.  Run the game and drag the Start or Finish Part around and watch the path update.

5.  Place obstacles in between and observe the path calculate around it. (If it does not seem like the path is going around the obstacle, make sure to make the obstacle tall)
