## Step-By-Step 3: NPC Going from Point to Point

Let's learn how to create and move NPCs!

We will be utilizing the following topics:

- Avatar / Rig Builder
- Parts
- Script

  

### Step 1: Create the NPC’s Body
In order to make a Non-Player Character (NPC) move, it needs a body first.
    
1.  Select Avatar --> Rig Builder (in red). Choose any type.

2.  Unanchor the HumanoidRootPart or else the NPC will not move.
    - In Explorer, hover over the Dummy and click the triangle to show all the parts in the Dummy.

    - Scroll down to "HumanoidRootPart". Click on it (in red). Under its properties, go to Part (in blue) --> Anchored. Make sure Anchored is *not* checked (in yellow).

### Step 2: Plotting Down the NPC’s Route Points
We will create the NPC’s route by putting down flatten Parts.
1. Create 2 platforms
    - Select Model --> Part --> Block (in red)

    - Click on the Part in the workspace then under Model --> Scale (in red). Resize the part so that it is a long rectangle.

    - Click on the Part in the workspace. Ctrl + C and then Ctrl + V to copy and paste an identical platform. Now you should have 2 identical platforms. Change the color / material to whatever you want.

2. Create 4 flatten circles with the colors red, yellow, green and blue.
    - Go to Model --> Part --> Cylinder (in red)
    
        ![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1p2gkzbaXla6Bb9GcLYOGqKeE8mK_F6lR)

    - Click on the Part in the Explorer. Go to Properties --> Size. Change the X, Y, Z to 0.2, 8, 10, respectively.

    - The orientation is a little off. For the same part, go to Properties --> CFrame --> Orientation. Change the X, Y, Z to 0, 0, 90, respectively.

    - Click on the Part in the workspace. Ctrl + C and then Ctrl + V three times to copy and paste three more flatten circles. Now you should have 4 identical flatten circles. Change the color red, yellow, green, and blue. The goals are also placed on 2 separated platforms to demonstrate the NPC jumping later.

2.  Click each Part --> Properties --> Name (in red). Rename each flatten circle parts to: goal1, goal2, goal3, goal4.

### Step 3: Creating the NPC’s Script

1.  Download the NPC script from this link: [http://bit.ly/roblox3_3_npcmovescript](http://bit.ly/roblox3_3_npcmovescript)
    
2. Go back to Roblox studio. Go to Home --> Toolbox (in red) --> 2nd column (in blue) --> My Models. You should see a script named NPCMoveScript (in yellow) there. Click and drag the script to Exporer and into the Dummy you created in Step 1.

3.  Depending on how you named your route points, open the script (double click the NPCMoveScript in Explorer) and edit the goals variable if needed. The NPC will move to each Part in chronological order.

4.  Run your game and watch your NPC move!
