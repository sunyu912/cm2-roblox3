## Lesson 10: Conga Line (Part 2)

### Summary and Learning Objective(s):
For this lesson, we will use the completed Follower to clone and form the line. We will also create a UI to configure how long we want the line to be.

Features:
- The line will be dynamic.
- Decreasing the line by one will destroy the farthest follower.
- Increasing the line by one will add onto the last in line.  


### Class Schedule/Tasks:

### Step 1: Form the Line!
When the player spawns, we want to:
-  Have 0 Followers along with a UI to add or subtract the amount of Followers we want.
-  Create a folder with the Player's Name to store all of the Follower clones.
-  Have a script that constantly compare the current amount of Followers versus the max amount of Followers we want.
-  If it is too little or too much, we will clone more or destroy more Followers.

1. Transfer the Follower model (from Lesson 9) into ServerStorage for cloning. Left click the Follower model from Workspace, drag and drop it into ServerStorage.

2. Let's first create a script in ServerScriptService (does not matter if you place this in the Workspace too! This is just for organizational purposes) named SpawnScript that will set up the data values that we need when a new Player spawns in:
    - Hover over ServerScriptService in the Explorer. Click on the + (plus) sign and in the options that show up, click on Script (in red).

        ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/cm-image-repository.appspot.com/roblox_3/Deprecated%20Lessons/L10/61a7d00b-cca9-456b-a1fc-23c168d97d80.png)
        
        ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/cm-image-repository.appspot.com/roblox_3/Deprecated%20Lessons/L10/917ac517-6e2b-4574-8a60-da58fb0051c4.png)
    - Rename the Script to SpawnScript. Click on the Script that you just created. Go to Properties => Data => Name and change the Name to SpawnScript (in red). 
      
        ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/cm-image-repository.appspot.com/roblox_3/Deprecated%20Lessons/L10/04266cf4-d621-462b-9278-5c0bb8321c5e.png)
    
    - This script will create 2 IntValues named, maxFollowersInt and currFollowersInt. It will also create a Folder with the Player's Name to store cloned Followers. Copy and paste the following code into the SpawnScript:
    
        ```lua
        -- Variables
        local Players = game:GetService("Players")
        
        -- Function
        local function onCharacterAdded(character)
        
        	-- Creates an IntValue, sets parent to Character, renamed as maxFollowerInt, set Value to 0
        	local max = Instance.new("IntValue", character)
        	max.Name = "maxFollowersInt"
        	max.Value = 0
        
        	-- Creates an IntValue, sets parent to Character, renamed as currFollowerInt, set Value to 0
        	local curr = Instance.new("IntValue", character)
        	curr.Name = "currFollowersInt"
        	curr.Value = 0
        
        	-- Creates a Folder in Workspace with the Character's Name
        	local followers = Instance.new("Folder", game.Workspace)
        	followers.Name = character.Name
        
        	-- Duplicate the script that will clone/destroy Followers and set parent to Character
        	game.ServerStorage.FollowerHandlerScript:Clone().Parent = character
        end
        
        -- Start Up
        Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)
        	player.CharacterAdded:Connect(onCharacterAdded)
        end)
        ```
        
    
3.  Now create another script in ServerStorage for duplication that will constantly check the amount of Followers the Player wants. You do not want to put it in StarterPlayerScripts as it will not persist when the Player respawns.
    - Hover over ServerStorage in the Explorer. Click on the + (plus) sign and in the options that show up, click on Script (in red). 
      
        ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/cm-image-repository.appspot.com/roblox_3/Deprecated%20Lessons/L10/a8f43ad9-d914-4b2c-904b-3f15f5bf6f0e.png)

    - Name this script, FollowerHandlerScript. Click on the Script that you just created. Go to Properties --> Data --> Name and change the Name to FollowerHandlerScript (in red). 
    
        ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/cm-image-repository.appspot.com/roblox_3/Deprecated%20Lessons/L10/16d001c3-eb48-4b01-ad6d-8f5f8e259fb1.png)
        
    - In the FollowerHandlerScript, create a variable that store the Player's character, another to store the location of the Follower Folder, and a variable to keep track of who's last in line. Copy and paste the following in the FollowerHandlerScript:  
        ```lua
        -- Variables
        local character = script.Parent
        local followFolder = game.Workspace[character.Name]
        local lastObject = character
        ```
        
    - We want to FollowerHandlerScript to constantly check if currFollowers matches maxFollowers and balance the difference. Cloning a Follower will search the Folder for the one last in line and deleting a Follower will find the one last in line and destroy it. To do so, we will use the while wait(0.1) loop to prevent timeout while still constantly checking. Add the following code to your FollowerHandlerScript:
    
        ```lua
        -- Variables
        local character = script.Parent
        local followFolder = game.Workspace[character.Name]
        local lastObject = character
        
        -- Start Up
        while wait(0.1) do
        
        	local curr = character.currFollowersInt.Value
        	local max = character.maxFollowersInt.Value
        	
        	-- If there is only the Player and no other Followers, make Follower
        	if lastObject == character and 0 < max then
        		local follower = game.ServerStorage.Follower:Clone()
        		follower.Parent = followFolder
        		follower.FrontObject.Value = character
        		lastObject = follower
        		character.currFollowersInt.Value = curr + 1
        	end
        	
        	-- If there is at least one Follower, make Follower
        	if (0 < curr) and (curr < max) then
        		local follower = game.ServerStorage.Follower:Clone()
        		follower.Parent = followFolder
        		follower.FrontObject.Value = lastObject
        		lastObject = follower
        		character.currFollowersInt.Value = character.currFollowersInt.Value + 1
        	end
        	
        	-- If we need less Followers
        	if curr > max then
        		local temp = lastObject.FrontObject.Value
        		lastObject:Destroy()
        		lastObject = temp
        		character.currFollowersInt.Value = curr - 1
        	end
        	
        end
        ```

### Step 2: The Power to Influence the Line

Lastly, we need to set up the buttons to influence our Follower numbers (Reference Lesson 8 for more UI details)
    

1.  In the StarterGui folder, create a ScreenGui and name it FollowerGui.
    - Hover over StarterGui in the Explorer. Click on the + (plus) sign and in the search bar that shows up, search for ScreenGui (in red). Click on it.
    
        ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/cm-image-repository.appspot.com/roblox_3/Deprecated%20Lessons/L10/cf4d7efa-b26f-427a-b775-d7682b0084bf.png)

    - Click on the newly created ScreenGui in the Explorer. Go to Properties --> Data --> Name and change the Name to "FollowerGui". 
    
        ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/cm-image-repository.appspot.com/roblox_3/Deprecated%20Lessons/L10/dddf673b-ba61-4f19-afaa-ffc3528f4d4a.png)
    
2.  Create a label for the Follower configuration and place it wherever you like in the game. In the demo, the label will be called FollowerLabel.
    - Hover over FollowerGui in the Explorer. Click on the + (plus) sign and in the search bar that shows up, search for label (in red). Click on it to add.
      
        ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/cm-image-repository.appspot.com/roblox_3/Deprecated%20Lessons/L10/5583403f-e705-44a0-9902-3e948ed2e869.png)
        ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/cm-image-repository.appspot.com/roblox_3/Deprecated%20Lessons/L10/2de746e8-6e0b-4154-b533-6dca7546f159.png)

3.  Child a TextButton under FollowerLabel and name it minusButton. (Note: Having the buttons as a child of the label allows us to move the whole thing and keep the buttons relative to the label's position.)
    - Hover over FollowerLabel in the Explorer. Click on the + (plus) sign and in the search bar that shows up, search for TextButton (in red). Click on it to add.
    
        ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/cm-image-repository.appspot.com/roblox_3/Deprecated%20Lessons/L10/1e446f78-d81d-4df0-acfa-686001526377.png)

    - Click on the newly created TextButton. Go to Properties --> Data --> Name. Change the Name to "minusButton".
    
        ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/cm-image-repository.appspot.com/roblox_3/Deprecated%20Lessons/L10/62fdfa0e-7bc7-4ff4-8e43-1882d0585c94.png)
    
4. Child a script under minusButton and name it minusScript.
    - Hover over minusButton in the Explorer. Click on the + (plus) sign and in the search bar that shows up, search for Script (in red). Click on it to add. Change the Name to "minusScript".
      
        ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/cm-image-repository.appspot.com/roblox_3/Deprecated%20Lessons/L10/bbd95da6-2287-4b9e-a202-7a71c2031a68.png)
        
      ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/cm-image-repository.appspot.com/roblox_3/Deprecated%20Lessons/L10/4743d682-d9f1-42a8-add8-802beb01350d.png)
      
      
      
    - Add the following code into the minusScript:
        ```lua
        local player = script.Parent.Parent.Parent.Parent.Parent
        local character = player.Character
        
        script.Parent.MouseButton1Click:Connect(function()
        	if 1 <= character.maxFollowersInt.Value then
        		character.maxFollowersInt.Value = character.maxFollowersInt.Value - 1
        	end
        end)
        ```
    
5.  Duplicate the minusButton and name the clone plusButton.
    - Right click with your mouse on the minusButton. In the options that show up, click on Duplicate or click on minusButton and do ctrl + D
    
        ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/cm-image-repository.appspot.com/roblox_3/Deprecated%20Lessons/L10/8e9de694-1be8-4208-8689-e355af9cb964.png)
    - Click on the cloned minusButton and go to Properties --> Data --> Name. Change the Name to "plusButton".
      
        ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/cm-image-repository.appspot.com/roblox_3/Deprecated%20Lessons/L10/e229b7b7-4d06-439b-aea8-7630244ce373.png)
    - Click on the minusScript inside plusButton and rename it as plusScript. 
      
        ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/cm-image-repository.appspot.com/roblox_3/Deprecated%20Lessons/L10/2f50fc91-1fe1-47d4-8fba-fd8891eb16e2.png)

    - Delete the original code inside plusScript and copy and paste the following inside instead:
    
        ```lua
        local player = script.Parent.Parent.Parent.Parent.Parent
        local character = player.Character
        
        script.Parent.MouseButton1Click:Connect(function()
        	character.maxFollowersInt.Value = character.maxFollowersInt.Value + 1
        end)
        ```
    
7.  Of course, adjust the placement of the minus and plus buttons. (The buttons and the labels may be on top of another. Simply drag to the side to see and adjust). Change the text of the label/button by double clicking in the game.

7.  Alright, everything should be set! Test out that conga line by running your game! To spawn a Follower, click on the + sign of your Gui. The Followers would still be jittery, I have yet to find a way to smooth out it's movements.

### Post-Class Deliverables

1.  Help students finish up their programs. Ensure students save their product, give it a title, and upload it to ShareMyWorks. Greet parents as they arrive and passout/explain homework to students and ensure their parents know they have homework to bring back.
    
2.  For this class, remember to always have them publish their script on to Roblox. We will be grabbing them again and again for future lessons.
