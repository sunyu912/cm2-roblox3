# Step-By-Step 5: Chasing AI Enemy (Part 1)

  

  

## Step 1: Plot Down Zombie Recovery Locations

1.  Create an accessible touch pad that the zombie can walk onto and touch to recover their health.
    
2.  Name these touchpads to ZombieHealSpot as these are the name weâ€™ll use in the script to come.

## Step 2: Create a Touched Script for Zombie Leg

1.  Make sure you use the Zombie from the previous lesson or else you will have to remake it.
    
2.  On any part that will touch the ground, place an empty script inside.
    
3.  We want the Zombie to make sure it is a healing pad and immediately heal to max.

4.  If you want it to heal by increments, you will need to replace line 6 with a for-loop with wait().
    

## Step 3: Updating the MoveScript to Also Find Nearest Recovery Spot

1.  Go to this link and download the updated ZombieMoveScript.
    

1.  Link: [http://bit.ly/roblox3_5_zombiemovescript](http://bit.ly/roblox3_5_zombiemovescript)
    

3.  Drag the script into the Zombie Model and replace the previous one.
    
4.  Now the Zombie should also run away and heal when it is below a certain health threshold.
    

1.  To change the threshold, you will need to open up the script and view the variables on the top.
