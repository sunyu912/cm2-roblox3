# Lesson 3-6: Protective A.I. Companion (Part 1)

Let's learn how to create a protective A.I companion!

We will be utilizing the following topics:

- Rig Builder
- Parts
- Script

### Important Notes:

-   The lessons are written in more detail and hands-on if the students are willing to see the process.
-   Otherwise for larger classes and for the sake of time, the Step-By-Step is provided along with a link to the scripts. **The Step-By-Step is now updated. The directions including the link below should be updated as of 2021 July 7 for clarification.
    
-   Link: [https://bit.ly/roblox3_6_1](https://bit.ly/roblox3_6_1)
    
-   From there, an overview of what has changed between the previous iteration and the current iteration can be applied.

### Pathfinding Functions

Let’s begin using the pathfinding functions and see how they work.

1. Open Roblox Studio.

2. Click the + button next to Workspace, spawn a Model (red in image), and name it `Waypoints`.

### Creating Your Companion

We are going to be creating a similar script to the Zombie's from the previous lesson and tweaking it to turn it into a protective companion.

There are three things we need in a basic companion:       

- It should follow us with some distance.

- It should sense any enemies around us, given a detection range, and attack them.

- It should come back to the player when it can’t sense any enemies.         

  

1. Let's spawn in a dummy. In the Avatar tab, click Rig Builder (red in image).

2. In the newly-appeared Rig Builder, under the R15 tab, click Block Avatar(red in image).

3. You should see your Dummy appear. Take some time to color it if you'd like.

4. Under Dummy, rename Humanoid to `Companion` (red in image).

5. Click the + button next to Dummy, add a script (red in image), and rename it to `CompanionMoveScript`.  

   ![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1fuBIA4v7YTrfzIip8Ib-XKhYSUcZUOtJ)

7. Click the + button next to Dummy again, and add a Configuration (red in image).

![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1jznt0G4EE4yBfjep24LIfLN9Q4MGjVsC)

8. Click the + button next to Configuration, add a StringValue (red in image), and rename it to `Leader`. This will be used to store the name of the player the companion is supposed to follow when it spawns.

9. Click the + button next to Configuration again, add three IntValues (red in image), and rename them to `Damage`, `detectionRange`, and `gapRange`, respectively. These will allow us to change the Companion’s ranges and attack power without opening its script. Make sure your configuration looks like the second image.

### Spawning with a Companion

1. Drag the Dummy (named `Companion`) into Server Storage (red in image). This will allow us to easily duplicate it later.

2. Click the + button next to ServerScriptService, add a script, and rename it to `SpawnScript`.

   ![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-hElB8rmnCKi_mZwlD1H6uwTZG3d3qwM)

3. Inside `SpawnScript`, add this code. When a player spawns in, a companion is cloned and assigned that player’s name. The companion is also teleported on top of the player.      

   ```lua
   local Players = game:GetService("Players")
   
   local function onCharacterAdded(character)
   	local humanRoot = character.HumanoidRootPart
   	
   	local companion = game.ServerStorage.Companion:Clone()
   	companion.Parent = game.workspace
   	companion.Config.Leader.Value = character.Name
   	companion:MoveTo(humanRoot.Position)
   	
   
   end
   
   Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)
   	player.CharacterAdded:Connect(onCharacterAdded)
   end)
   ```

### Coding the CompanionMoveScript

Like in the previous lessons, we’ll be typing a similar script and modifying some of its functions and variables to fit our needs.

*Note: the following script will make the companion walk jittery because it is constantly updating, allowing it to follow the player. This will need improvement in the future.*

1. For the following steps, we will be coding in `CompanionMoveScript`. Open it up, and begin by adding this code, which contains variables needed for the next steps:

   ```lua
   -- ROBLOX 3 LESSON 6
   
   -- VARIABLES
   
   local NPC = script.Parent
   local config = NPC.Config
   local humanoid = NPC.Companion
   local damage = NPC.Config.Damage.Value
   local torso = NPC.UpperTorso
   
   local leader = nil
   local leaderName = nil
   
   local destination = nil
   local detectionRange = 20
   local gapRange
   local attack = false
   
   local path = game:GetService("PathfindingService"):CreatePath() -- Create Path object
   
   local waypoints = nil
   local currentWaypointIndex = nil
   local maxDist
   ```

2. Let’s write the function we have been using for the past few lessons, followPath(). Add this code:  
   ```lua
   -- FUNCTIONS
   
   local function followPath(objectRootPart)
   	
   	path:ComputeAsync(NPC.HumanoidRootPart.Position, objectRootPart.Position) -- Compute and check the path
   
   	waypoints = {} -- Empty waypoints table after each new path computation
   	
   	if path.Status == Enum.PathStatus.Success then
   		waypoints = path:GetWaypoints() -- Get the path waypoints and start zombie walking
   		
   		currentWaypointIndex = 1 -- Move to first waypoint
   		maxDist = currentWaypointIndex + gapRange
   		humanoid:MoveTo(waypoints[currentWaypointIndex].Position)		
   	else
   		humanoid:MoveTo(NPC.HumanoidRootPart.Position) -- Error (path not found); stop humanoid
   	end
   	
   end
   ```

3. Next up is the function findNearest(), which has been adjusted to remove the chase parameter from the Zombie version. It will now shuffle through to see if a zombie is nearby, else it will follow the player. Add this code:  
   ```lua
   function findNearest()
   	local list = game.Workspace:children()
   	local range = detectionRange
   	local nearest = nil
   
   	for x = 1, #list do
   		local object = list[x]
   		
   		if (object.className == "Model") and (object ~= script.Parent) then -- Find nearby Zombie
   			local targetRoot = object:findFirstChild("HumanoidRootPart")
   			local zombie = object:findFirstChild("Zombie")
   			
   			if (targetRoot ~= nil) and (zombie ~= nil) and (zombie.Health > 0) then -- If model has a RootPart, Humanoid, and above 0 HP...
   				if (targetRoot.Position - NPC.HumanoidRootPart.Position).magnitude < range then
   					nearest = targetRoot
   					range = (targetRoot.Position - NPC.HumanoidRootPart.Position).magnitude
   				end
   			end
   		end
   	end
   	
   	if nearest == nil then
   		attack = false
   		return leader.HumanoidRootPart
   	end
   	
   	attack = true
   	return nearest -- After going through the whole workspace, it will return the nearest Humanoid model.
   end
   ```

4. Compared to the Zombie script's version of this function, we adjusted an *if* statement to determine if the companion found an enemy or not, deciding how the companion moves. Following the player will leave a gap between them. Following the Zombie will not, thus it will touch to attack. Add this code:  
   *Note: this part causes the jittering due to the calling of findNearest on line 69.*  

   ```lua
   local function onWaypointReached(reached)
   	
   	if reached and not attack and (currentWaypointIndex < #waypoints) and (maxDist < #waypoints) then -- Calculate a gap when following player and not attacking.
   		currentWaypointIndex = currentWaypointIndex + 1
   		maxDist = currentWaypointIndex + gapRange
   		
   		if waypoints[currentWaypointIndex].Action.Value == 1 then 	-- We want the humanoid to Jump ahead of time, so after
   			humanoid.Jump = true									-- the currentWaypointIndex increased by, we check to see if 
   		end															-- the Action is Jump.
   		
   		humanoid:MoveTo(waypoints[currentWaypointIndex].Position)
   		
   	elseif reached and attack and (currentWaypointIndex < #waypoints) then -- When attacking. No gap in order to touch zombies.
   		currentWaypointIndex = currentWaypointIndex + 1
   		maxDist = currentWaypointIndex + gapRange
   
   		if waypoints[currentWaypointIndex].Action.Value == 1 then
   			humanoid.Jump = true
   		end
   		
   		humanoid:MoveTo(waypoints[currentWaypointIndex].Position)
   	else
   		destination = findNearest()
   		
   		if destination == leader.HumanoidRootPart then
   			config.Heal.Value = true
   		else
   			config.Heal.Value = false
   		end
   		
   		followPath(destination)
   	end
   end
   ```

7. Next, let’s write the functions for onPathBlocked() and onTorsoTouched(), which allow the companion to check for obstacles and deal damage if it touches a Zombie-type humanoid. Add this code:
   ```lua
   local function onPathBlocked(blockedWaypointIndex)
   	
   	if blockedWaypointIndex > currentWaypointIndex then -- Check if the obstacle is further down the path
   		followPath(destination) -- Call function to re-compute the path
   	end
   		
   end
   
   local function onTorsoTouched(otherPart)
   	local targetHumanoid = otherPart.Parent:FindFirstChild("Zombie")
   	
   	if targetHumanoid ~= nil then
   		targetHumanoid:TakeDamage(damage)
   	end
   end
   ```

8.  Finally, we need to take the name of the player assigned and search for their Character in order to get their position in the game. Thus, we’ll define a new function: getPlayerFromName(). You’ll notice a repeat-loop assigning the Leader’s value to our leaderName variable—this is because it isn’t immediately registered, and it needs some time before it updates. That's why we wait until we get the information we need before continuing. Let’s also not forget to connect the functions to the events! Add this code:  
    ```lua
    -- Find the player object with the name value assigned to Leader
    local function getPlayerFromName(name)
    	local Players = game:GetService("Players")
    	for _, player in pairs(Players:GetPlayers()) do
    		if player.Name:lower() == name:lower() then
    			return player.Character
    		end
    	end
    	
    end
    
    -- CONNECT EVENTS
    
    humanoid.MoveToFinished:Connect(onWaypointReached) -- Connect 'MoveToFinished' event to the 'onWaypointReached' function
    
    path.Blocked:Connect(onPathBlocked) -- Connect 'Blocked' event to the 'onPathBlocked' function
    
    torso.Touched:Connect(onTorsoTouched) -- Connect 'Touched' event to the 'onTorsoTouched' function
    
    -- START UP
    
    repeat -- Repeat until we find a target
    	wait(0.1)
    	leaderName = config.Leader.Value
    	detectionRange = config.detectionRange.Value
    	gapRange = config.gapRange.Value
    until (leaderName ~= nil) and (detectionRange ~= nil) and (gapRange ~= nil)
    
    leader = getPlayerFromName(leaderName)
    config.PlayerCharacterObject.Value = leader
    destination = leader.HumanoidRootPart
    
    followPath(destination) -- Call this function once to start the forever change
    ```



Congratulations—your A.I. Companion is completed! Click play to test it out.

  

## Post-Class Deliverables

1.  Help students finish up their programs. Ensure students save their product, give it a title, and upload it to ShareMyWorks. Greet parents as they arrive and passout/explain homework to students and ensure their parents know they have homework to bring back.
    
2.  For this class, remember to always have them publish their script on Roblox. We will be grabbing them again and again for future lessons.
