## Lesson 9: Conga Line (Part 1)

### Summary and Learning Objective(s):

-   Made as a two-parter in case students need help catching up or would like to take the time to review.
    
-   A fun lesson where we create a line of Humanoids following the Player.
    
-   This spans for 2 lessons to make sure students can take their time and understand how to create this project step-by-step.
    
-   For this lesson we will be focusing on creating the Follower and the FollowerMoveScript.  
    

### Step 1: Creating a Follower
Use this as a review to recreate a Companion, but this time the Follower will have no other features except to follow their assigned target.
    
1.  Select Avatar --> Rig Builder (in red). From the options that show up, you may choose any option, but we recommend a R6 Block Avatar.

2. Change the name of the model from "Rig" to "Follower"
    - Click on the Rig model in the explorer. Go to Properties --> Data --> Name (in red). Change the Name to "Follower"

3. Within the model, change the name of "Humanoid" to "Follower"
    - Click on the triangle to the left of the model to see what is inside (in red). Click on Humanoid (in blue) --> Properties --> Data --> Name (in yellow) and change the Name to "Follower"

4.  Un-Anchor the HumanoidRootPart of your newly spawned rig. This will allow the model to actually move!
    - Under the Follower model, you should see "HumanoidRootPart" (in red). Click on it and go to Properties --> scroll down to Part (in blue) --> Anchored --> make sure the box is unchecked (in yellow).

5.  Place an ObjectValue into the model and name it FrontObject. FrontObject will store who the Follower is following.
    - Hover over the Follower model in the Explorer. Click on the + (plus) sign and in the search bar that shows up, search for ObjectValue (in red). Click on it.

    - Click on the ObjectValue you just created. Go to Properties --> Data --> Name and change the name to "FrontObject" (in red).

### Step 2: Script - Is the target moving and how do I follow?
This will be almost the same as how we created the NPC, Zombie, and Companion MoveScripts minus the extra features.

1.  Hover over the Follower model, click on the + (plus) sign and add a Script. Rename the Script as FollowerMoveScript.

2.  First, we will lay out the variables. Copy and paste the following code into your FollowerMoveScript script:  
    ```lua 
    -- Variables
    
    local model = script.Parent
    local humanoid = model.Follower
    local front
    local frontPosition
    
    local path = game:GetService("PathfindingService"):CreatePath()
    local waypoints
    local currentWaypointIndex
    ```
    
    - Note: you will see 2 variables that are not familiar: front and `frontPosition`.
      
        1.  `front` will hold the object the follower is following such as Player or another Follower.
            
        2.  `frontPosition` will hold the position of the one it is following and will only update after we have reached its snapshotted position. This will be useful to prevent every Follower from constantly updating and calculating a path.

Next, create the functions needed to calculate and move to the specified target.
    
3.  First function is followPath( ). Copy and paste the following code underneath the variable code tbat you pasted above:  
    ```lua
    -- Functions
    
    local function followPath(objectRootPart)
    	path: ComputeAsync(model.HumanoidRootPart.Position, objectRootPart.Position)
    	waypoints = {}
    
    	if path.Status == Enum.PathStatus.Success then
    		waypoints = path:GetWaypoints ()
    		currentWaypointIndex = 1
    		humanoid:MoveTo(waypoints[currentWaypointIndex].Position)
    	else
    		humanoid:MoveTo(model.HumanoidRootPart.Position)
    	end
    	
    end
    ```
    
    - This is nothing different than before. This function will take in a root Part in order to access its position.
    - Once the calculated path is deemed successful, it will proceed to move the Follower to the first position.
    
4.  Second function is the event MoveToFinished connected with a function. Add the following code to your script by copy and pasting:  
    ```lua
    humanoid.MoveToFinished:Connect(function(reached)
    
    	if reached and currentWaypointIndex < #waypoints - 3 then
    		currentWaypointIndex = currentWaypointIndex + 1
    
    		if waypoints[currentWaypointIndex].Action.Value == 1 then
    			humanoid.Jump = true
    		end
    
    		humanoid:MoveTo(waypoints [currentWaypointIndex].Position)
    	else
    		repeat
    			wait (0.1)
    		until frontPosition ~= front.HumanoidRootPart.Position
    
    		frontPosition = front.HumanoidRootPart.Position
    
    		followPath (front.HumanoidRootPart)
    	end
    
    end)
    ```
    
    - This event will trigger as the Follower moves to its destinations, minus a few so there is a gap between each Follower.
    - Once it reached every single waypoint, it will repeat-loop to check if it's front leader has moved or not.
        1.  If it hasn't, keep looping and doing nothing.
        2.  If the position has changed, break out of the loop, update the new position, and calculate a new path again.
    
5.  Finally, we'll kick start the program to loop after we receive all the information we need. Copy and paste the following code and at it to the end of your program: 
    ```lua
    -- Start Up
    
    repeat
    	wait(0.1)
    	front = model.FrontObject.Value
    until (front ~= nil)
    
    frontPosition = front.HumanoidRootPart.Position
    
    followPath(front.HumanoidRootPart)
    ```

    - Similar to what we have seen previously, we are using a repeat-loop to make sure we get front assigned with a value and not nil.     
    -  After it has been assigned and we have saved it's current Position, we can proceed with the program by calling followPath.
       

### Post-Class Deliverables

1.  Help students finish up their programs. Ensure students save their product, give it a title, and upload it to ShareMyWorks. Greet parents as they arrive and pass out/explain homework to students and ensure their parents know they have homework to bring back.
    
2.  For this class, remember to always have them publish their script on to Roblox. We will be grabbing them again and again for future lessons.
