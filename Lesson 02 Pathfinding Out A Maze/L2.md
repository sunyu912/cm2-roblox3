
## Step-By-Step 2: Pathfinding Out A Maze

Let's learn maze pathfinding!

We will be utilizing the following topics:

- Parts
- Model
- Tool
- Script

  
### Step 1: Setting Up the Finish Goal

1.  Spawn a Part in Workspace (in red).

### Step 2: Making the Maze Hint Tool

1. Add a Tool into Workspace and rename it as HintTool.
   - Hover over Workspace and click on the + (plus) sign
   - Under the search bar, type “Tool” and click on the Tool option that shows up (in red).

   - Click on the Tool and under Properties --> Data --> Name, change the name to "HintTool" (in red)

2. Add a Model into Workspace and rename it as Waypoints.

   - Hover over Workspace and click on the + (plus) sign
   - Under the search bar, type “Model” and click on the Model option that shows up (in red).

   - Click on the Model and under Properties --> Data --> Name, change the name to "Waypoints" (make sure this is spelled right, case sensitive)

3. Spawn a Part, place it inside our HintTool, and rename it to Handle (so that the players can pick it up).
   - Select Model --> Part (in red)

   - Under the Explorer, click and hold the Part. Drag and drop it into HintTool.

4. Design the HintTool however you like (e.g. color, shape, or adding an image, possible example below).

5. Hover over HintTool, click on the + (plus) sign and add a Script. Rename the Script as HintToolScript.

6. Copy and Paste the following code inside the script:
   ```lua
   local debounce = false
   local tool = script.Parent
   
   tool.Activated:Connect(function()
   
   	if debounce == false then
   		debounce = true
   
   		local character = tool.Parent.HumanoidRootPart
   		local finish = workspace.Finish
   		local path = game:GetService("PathfindingService"):CreatePath()
   
   			path:ComputeAsync(character.Position, finish.Position)
   			local waypoints = path:GetWaypoints()
   
   			for _, waypoint in pairs(waypoints) do
   				local part = Instance.new("Part")
   				part.Shape = "Ball"
   				part.Material = "Neon"
   				part.Size = Vector3.new(0.6, 0.6, 0.6)
   				part.Position = waypoint.Position
   				part.Anchored = true
   				part.CanCollide = false
   				part.Parent = game.Workspace.Waypoints
   			end
   
   			wait (2)
   			local points = workspace.Waypoints:GetChildren()
   			for i = 1, #points do
   				points[i]:Destroy()
   				wait (1)
   			end
   		
   			debounce = false
   		end
   end)
   ```


6.  Place the HintTool into your StarterPack.
    - Click and hold `HintTool`. Drag and drop it into `StarterPack` (in red, scroll down to `StarterPack`).

7.  Run your game! Equip the `HintTool`. Activate/use the tool by left clicking your mouse. Watch as a line connects from your Character to the part named "Finish", disappearing after a certain amount of time.
