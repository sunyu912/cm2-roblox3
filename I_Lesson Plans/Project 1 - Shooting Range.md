### Making a Shooting Range

You will need a couple of things to make the map work.

1. The map

   - Get 2 parts (red in image)

   - Add BrickColor and Material (blue in image)

   - Rename them from top to bottom: "Level1" and "Fence"

3. Target NPC's

   - We will be using the NPC's we made for one of the Roblox 3 Lesson 3!
   
   - Get the NPC from here: https://www.roblox.com/library/8838368863/Walking-NPC
   
   - Check the "Inventory" in the Toolbox to get the NPC (red in image) and drag and drop it into the game

   - Place the NPC on the "Level1" part and separate the cylinders ("grey1" and "grey2") on the opposing ends as seen in the image below

   - Duplicate the NPC, cylinders and "Level1" to re-color and rename them as you desire
   
   - An example below could be "NPC 2", "green1", "green2", and "Level2"

   - Remember to edit the "NPCMoveScript" within the NPC with the name of the new goals. In this case from "grey1/2" to "green1/2"

4. Bow and Arrow

   - Get the bow and arrow from here: https://www.roblox.com/library/7813770407/Bow

   - Check the "Inventory" in the Toolbox to get the NPC (red in image) and drag and drop it into the game

     ![image-20220215223724474](C:\Users\Lenovo\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220215223724474.png)

   - Make sure you open the bow and place the "Arrow" (red in image) in the folder on "Replicated Storage" (blue in image)
   
     ![image-20220215224845056](C:\Users\Lenovo\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220215224845056.png)
     
   - You may delete the folder if you wish. Optionally add the "Bow" onto "StarterPack" so all players get one when playing
   
   - Great job! You can add more decorations and levels to the shooting range, get creative!
