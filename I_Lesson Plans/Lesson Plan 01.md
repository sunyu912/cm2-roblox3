* Introduce Roblox’s Pathfinding service
* Create a script that visualizes the path

<h2>Preparation</h2>




* Make sure each student can log into their Roblox account
* Make sure each student can log into their ShareMyWorks account
* Print out the assignment

<h2>Class Schedule/Tasks:</h2>


<h3>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h3>




1. Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer program or a machine to think and learn.
    1. It is made to mimic human thinking by learning and problem solving.
    2. An ideal AI can take in its environment and decide on the best action to maximize its success for some goal.
2. Discuss with students what AIs are out in the present-day world
    3. Ex: Understanding human speech, strategy games (Chess, Go), self-driving car

<h3>Introducing Roblox’s AI Pathfinding</h3>




1. A majority of Roblox games are fun partly because it is multiplayer and partly because of AI programming.
2. Roblox Studio has a built-in pathfinding functionality that allows you to create smarter and more dynamic NPCs (non-player characters) that follow much more comprehensive paths.
    1. Meaning instead of programming an NPC to follow a fixed path that needs to be adjusted manually, the pathfinding functions will continuously churn out better routes if the environment changes.
    2. Dynamic means a constant state of alteration
        1. Players moving
        2. Terrain shifting

<h3>Creating and Visualizing the Pathfinding Script</h3>




1. Roblox’s pathfinding function calculates the route through a fixed size of 1 x 1 x 1 studs.
2. Picture the Roblox world simplified into cubes of the exact same size (like a checkerboard).
    1. The system will ask itself “What’s the least amount of cubes I need to cross to get to my target?”
3. Let’s start using the pathfinding functions and see how it works. Open up Roblox Studio.
    2. Spawn in a Model into Workspace and name it Waypoints
    3. Spawn in 2 Parts into Workspace and name one Start and another Finish
    4. Create a script into Workspace, you can rename it to PathfindingScript
4. Within the script is the following: \

5. Now Run the program. It should look like this: \

6. You can drag the Start or Finish part around and watch the path change. You can even place a block in between them and watch the path go around or over it.

<h3>Post-Class Deliverables</h3>




1. Help students finish up their programs. Ensure students save their product, give it a title, and upload it to ShareMyWorks. Greet parents as they arrive and passout/explain homework to students and ensure their parents know they have homework to bring back.
2. For this class, remember to always have them publish their script on to Roblox. We will be grabbing them again and again for future lessons.
